Kick off workflows with GitHub events like:
- Push
- Issue creation
- New release.

GitHub Actions is a [[Continuous Integration]] platform that allows you to:

- #Automate your build, [[Test]], and [[Deployment]] pipeline.
- Create #workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
- Run a #workflow to automatically add the appropriate [[Github Labels]] whenever someone creates a new issue in your [[Repository]].

GitHub provides Linux, Windows, and macOS [[Virtual  Machines]] to run your workflows, or you can host your own self-hosted runners in your own [[Data Center]] or cloud infrastructure.
