- Instead of adding more machines/nodes to our infrastructure like we do in [[Horizontal Scaling]], we add more power to the already existing machines/nodes.
- Centralized work load
- Must deal with [[Concurrency]] by making use of [[Multi-threading]]
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Less overhead
- Limited to how much we can make 1 machine PUMP IT
- Cheaper

- Example: Add CPU/RAM/Disk to an existing VM/Physical machine
