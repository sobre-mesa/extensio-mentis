[[CDN]]/[[HTTPS]] Caching is a form of [[Caching]], applied to this specific Web Scenario

Making use of [[Proxy Severs]], these will store responses to speed up the process
- Its mostly static files like: 
	- Videos
	- Music
	- JS
	- Template Images
	- CSS Files
- Cheaper to cache than to process the data/get a response from the origin backend server every time 
- With a distributed CDN, can make content faster to be accessed from different parts of the world, improving [[User Experience]]
- Layer of security, for example against DDOS attacks
