- Adding more nodes/machines to your infrastructure to cope with demand. 
- May add [[Complexity]]
- Distributed Workload
- Also REQUIRES a distributed architecture
- Inherently deals with [[Concurrency]]
- More overhead, harder to implement correctly too
- Makes it easier to handle availability , since we can switch between nodes in case one of them is unavailable
- Makes [[Load Balancing]] a necessity
- Infinitely scalable, can always add more machines
- More expensive, and more expensive to get started with

Should only be used as an option if needed, because of the increased development, infrastructure, and maintenance costs

- Need to scale
- Need to implement microservices
