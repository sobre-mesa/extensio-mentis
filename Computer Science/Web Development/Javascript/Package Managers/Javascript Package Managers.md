[[Javascript]] has a few options:

- [[npm]]: Default and widely used, improved performance in recent versions.
- [[yarn]]: Faster and more reliable than older [[npm]] versions, good for monorepos, enhanced user experience.
- [[pnpm]]: Most performant with efficient disk usage, strict package management, excellent for large projects and monorepos.

#### **Comparison of Installation Process Across the Package Managers**

- [[NPM]] installs packages in a nested manner, creating a separate node_modules directory for each package.
- [[Yarn]] installs packages in a flat manner, trying to avoid duplication.
- [[PNPM]] uses a global store for all packages and creates hard links to the packages in the node_modules directory of your project.

#### **Handling of Malicious Packages: [[NPM]] vs [[Yarn]] vs [[PNPM]]**

- All three package managers provide means to report malicious packages, which are removed from the registry upon verification.
- The responsibility of avoiding malicious packages also lies with the developers, who should ensure the credibility of packages before installing them.

#### **Disk Space Efficiency: A Comparative Analysis**

- [[PNPM]] stands out in terms of disk space efficiency by using a global store for all packages and linking them to the projects.
- [[Yarn]] also tries to be efficient by installing packages in a flat manner, but it can lead to version conflicts.
- [[NPM]], with its nested installation approach, can use more disk space as it installs multiple copies of the same package if different dependencies require them.

#### **Dependency Tree Management Across the Package Managers**

- [[NPM]] uses a nested dependency tree, ensuring that each package gets the exact version of its dependencies.
- [[Yarn]] uses a flat dependency tree, trying to reduce duplication of packages.
- [[PNPM]] creates a non-flat node_modules structure and provides a flattened view of the dependencies through a lockfile.

#### **Package Lock Features in NPM, Yarn, and PNPM**

- All three package managers use a **lockfile** to install the same dependencies across all environments.
- [[NPM]] uses a **package-lock.json**, [[Yarn]] uses a **yarn.lock** file, and [[PNPM]] uses a **pnpm-lock.yaml** file.
