#AWSLambda belongs to the #AWSCompute in [[AWS]]

#AWSLambda is named after the concept of [[Lambda Functions]],

Can host #Python, #C, and others, but more importantly, #NodeJS

Instead of having a server or elastically expanding to more servers on demand, #ServerlessComputing lets us just host specific functions, which will be used and "turned on" on demand

This is what they mean with #Noinfrastructure or #ServerlessComputing , you dont pay for a server, you pay based on how much you compute through your function.
